    <h2>What is the CSS `display` property and can you give a few examples of its use?</h2>

    <p>The common values for the display property: none, block, inline, inline-block, flex, grid, 
      table, table-row, table-cell, list-item.</p>

    <p>
      none	Does not display an element (the element no longer affects the layout of the document). 
      All child element are also no longer displayed. The document is rendered as if the element 
      did not exist in the document tree.<br/>
      block	The element consumes the whole line in the block direction (which is usually horizontal).
      inline	Elements can be laid out beside each other.
      inline-block	Similar to inline, but allows some block properties like setting width and height.
      flex	Behaves as a block-level flex container, which can be manipulated using flexbox model.
      grid	Behaves as a block-level grid container using grid layout.
      table	Behaves like the element.
      table-row	Behaves like the element.
      table-cell	Behaves like the  element.
      list-item	Behaves like a element which allows it to define list-style-type and list-style-position.
