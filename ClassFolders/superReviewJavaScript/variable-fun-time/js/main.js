//--- Easy
//create a variable and assign it a number

let num = 23345535


//minus 10 from that number

num = num - 10

//print that number to the console

console.log(num)

//--- Medium
//create a variable that holds a value from the input


//add 25 to that number

let add25 = minusTen + 25

//alert that number

alert(add25)

//--- Hard
//create a variable that holds the h1



//add an event listener to that element that console logs the sum of the two previous variables
